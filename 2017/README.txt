Introduction
We have 2 biological examples of single cell transcriptomics, one in melanoma (cite) and another one in glioblastoma (cite).
We will use the melanoma case to learn about clustering (unsupervised learning). We will cluster without prior information malignant cells from different patients.
Then, we will use the glioblastoma case to learn about classification (supervised learning). We will classify immune cells in glioblastoma to known signatures of expression.


Case 1. Unsupervised learning of melanoma samples

Case 2. Supervised learning of glioblastoma associated immune cell types.
