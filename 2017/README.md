# Introduction
In this session we will apply unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms to single cell transcriptome data.
Please make sure you have your our required R packages installed.
Start RStudio and load the script __requisites.r__.

## Case 1. Unsupervised learning of melanoma malignant cells.
We will study inter patient variability by defining clusters of malignant melanoma cells for different patients.
In our first example, we will use data from xx single cell transcriptomes of melanoma samples (Tirosh et al., 2016).
We will use the melanoma case to learn about clustering (unsupervised learning). We will cluster without prior information malignant cells from different patients.

## Case 2. Supervised learning of glioblastoma associated immune cell types.
Then, we will use the glioblastoma case to learn about classification (supervised learning). We will classify immune cells in glioblastoma to known signatures of expression.
